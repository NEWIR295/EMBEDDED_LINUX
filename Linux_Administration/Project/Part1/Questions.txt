1) We want to make this script globally reachable (i.e. you can run from anywhere in the system
without indicating its path, so that we could use “userdef” instead of “./userdef”).

    m) How can we achieve this (2 methods) ? Write the steps to these 2 methods in a text file.
        -Method1: using alias userdef="sudo /home/newir529/EMBEDDED_LINUX/Linux_Administration/Project/Part1/userdef.sh"
        -Method2: we could make move it in /usr/local/bin/
    n) We would like this change to be permanent, how can we do this?
        -Method1: we add alias script in .bashrc file 
        -Method2: no need once we move it in /usr/local/bin/
    o) We just made this change permanent, but we don’t want to wait until another terminal is
    opened, we would like to make this change NOW, and in this terminal. What could we do?
        -Method1: we source .bashrc file 
        -Method2: no need once we move it in /usr/local/bin/

2) After running the second script, do the following:
    g) Switch to the newly created user
        - su - ${new_user}
    h) Display all the files inside the extracted folder recursively and with long listing format
        - ls -Ril
    i) Change to owner of this directory recursively to be the new user
        - sudo chown -R ${new_user} ${directory}
    j) Again, display all the files inside the extracted folder recursively and with long listing format
        - ls -R
    k) Search for the word “file” in the extracted directory recursively
        - grep -r "file" .
    l) Remove all the files ending with “.c”
        - rm *.c
